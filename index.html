          I am particularly interested in utilizing my talents within either the biomedical or aerospace industries.

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p class="Programming-description">I have worked with multiple languages and programs throughout my career.
            I've used MatLab for engineering, and Python for inventory management. I recently added Full Stack Web Development tools to my arsenal,
            including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, SQL, and React.js, to name a few.
            I intend to continue learning and expanding my programming languages to become an even more valuable asset.</p>

          <h3>Project Management</h3>
          <p class="Project-Management-description">While completing my MBA, I discovered that I enjoyed project management and the challenges that
            come with coordinating and balancing tasks. My experience managing projects started much earlier, likely with my Eagle Scout project in highschool.
            After graduating from The University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Business with my MBA,
            I gained some additional experience on a team of project managers in the construction industry.</p>

          <h3>Engineering</h3>
          <p class="Engineering-description">I've always enjoyed the process of designing things and then developing those plans into a tangible product.
            As a child, I would play with LEGOs for hours on end. In highschool, I dabbled in 3D Modeling and actually produced a simple prosthetic hand
            for children with inadequately-developed hands and fingers. This experience is what led me to pursue a BS in Mechanical Engineering at The
            University of Alabama. It is also what kickstarted my interest in working within the biomedical engineering industry to improve the lives of others.</p>
